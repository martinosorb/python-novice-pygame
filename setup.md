## Installing Python Using Anaconda

Please refer to the [Python section of the workshop website for installation instructions.](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#python)

## Installing Pygame
In this lesson, we are going to make heavy use of a library called [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) for game development in Python.
Libraries are publicly available sets of commands which are ready to import and use in our own code.

Anaconda (our Python distribution) does not come with PyGame pre-installed.
To install it, open Anaconda Navigator, then the Anaconda Prompt app, and into the terminal that opens, type
```bash
pip install pygame
```

If all goes well, you'll receive a message saying that PyGame has been successfully installed.
